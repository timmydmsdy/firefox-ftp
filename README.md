Per Privacytools.io
Mozilla decided to include a unique download token in downloads from the Firefox website and uses telemetry to send the token and assign users with IDs. However, releases from the Mozilla FTP doesn't include the token. If you don't like any of this circus, choose LibreWolf instead.

As a result, this is the standard Firefox Cask for Homebrew, but the file is pulled from the FTP site instead of the HTTPS directory.
